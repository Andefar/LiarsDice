# Requirements
The final assignment of the course is writing a research paper. The papers
should be:
• coauthored by three to four students;

• maximum 8 pages long;

• typeset in latex;

• featuring Introduction, Main Matter, Conclusions with Further Work and
full Bibliography;

• concerned with an overview of the chosen problem, modelling, design,
analysis, or simulations (with the use of techniques taught in class) placed
within the context of existing research on the topic.
The timeline is as follows:

• Thursday, November 17th, beginning of the topic selection and research
group forming.

• Sunday, November 20th, deadline for submitting the commitments to
groups and topics.

• Sunday, December 4th, deadline for submitting final papers.

The basic approach to this assignment is to write an overview paper based
on the proposed literature. You are encouraged however to find a specific issue
you wish to focus on in your work. Please feel free to ask questions though email.
If you wish you can also send me a plan of your paper halfway through the
project period (i.e., on or before Nov 27th) and I will send you some intermediate
feedback.
